 secondary_turret_small_cannonx2:0 "Twin Small Cannons"
 secondary_turret_small_cannonx2_desc:0 "Two small cannons mounted in secondary turrets. While this configuration significantly increases soft and hard attack, the added complexity and exposed modules reduce reliability and slightly lower the vehicle's hardness. Effective for breakthrough roles and infantry support."

 secondary_turret_small_cannonx3:0 "Triple Small Cannons"
 secondary_turret_small_cannonx3_desc:0 "A rare configuration using three small cannons in multiple turrets. Devastating against infantry and light targets, but highly complex and maintenance-heavy. The increased firepower comes at the cost of severely reduced reliability and armor integrity."

 secondary_turret_hmgx2:0 "Dual Heavy Machine Guns"
 secondary_turret_hmgx2_desc:0 "Two heavy machine guns mounted in secondary turrets. This setup increases soft attack and breakthrough potential, allowing the tank to engage more infantry targets, but at the cost of reduced reliability and slightly lower armor effectiveness."

 secondary_turret_hmgx3:0 "Triple Heavy Machine Guns"
 secondary_turret_hmgx3_desc:0 "Three heavy machine guns installed in separate secondary turrets. This overwhelming firepower is highly effective against soft targets, but the complexity of the layout severely compromises reliability and vehicle integrity."
